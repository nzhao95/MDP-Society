# Markov Society
Little Experiment on implementing a Reinforcement learning model and train a little world with humans and resources from scratch. 

## Q-Learning 
The first try is usual basic Markov Decision Process and Q learning algorithm to train some policies on humans. The major difficulty with this method is to make a clear state and action model. The system is then reward driven to converge to a policy that hopefully allows the humans to survive longer.
